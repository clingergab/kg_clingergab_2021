# kg_clingergab_2021

Program that converts an an array of integers into an array of strings representing the phonetic equivalent of the integer.

Input should be given as arguments when running. The program checks for negative numbers in which case outputs Negative. If non numeric input is give or if no input is given the program terminates with error. 

The code of the program is all written in main.go, as the instructions request for it to be executed using "go run main.go". Idealy however, I would have seperated most of the code into a seperate file, but this would require a different execution command.
